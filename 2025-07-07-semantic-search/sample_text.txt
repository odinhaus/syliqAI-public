Good lighting improves video quality significantly. Position your camera at eye level and ensure your background is uncluttered. Natural light or a soft ring light is ideal for professional calls.

Workplace Ergonomics

Adjust your chair and monitor to reduce strain. Keep your elbows at 90 degrees and your monitor at arm’s length to maintain healthy posture during long work sessions.

Deploying Python Apps with Docker

Docker simplifies app deployment by containerizing dependencies. Build an image with a Dockerfile, run it with `docker run`, and expose ports as needed. For Python apps, start from a base image like `python:3.10-slim`.

Common Git Pitfalls

One common issue is committing large files accidentally. Use `.gitignore` to exclude generated files and binary data. Also, avoid rebasing shared branches unless you coordinate with your team.

Custom GPT Applications

You can fine-tune LLMs or use prompt engineering to build tools that summarize, extract, or classify content. Embedding-based retrieval with Qdrant or Pinecone enables context-aware assistants that actually understand your documents.
